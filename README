To set up the Project start Apache Service and MySQL with XAMPP.

Go to user-auth/db.php and replace:
$user = 'users_admin';
$pass = 'R7otZjq9o#gP1jg*';

with:
$user = 'root';
$pass = '';

Open MyPhPAdmin and run the code in SQL-Script.txt

Now your Database is set up and the Project-set-up is completed.
